 Dear Danya and Victor, 

 First off, we would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to work with you, and that you trusted us to build an appliction that you found to be a useful addition to your set of research tools. We really appreciate all the time and help you have offered us throughout the term. 
 
 --- What we did (underlined) ---

 We were able to complete a large majority of the features and users story that you asked of us. Of course our primary objective was to allow users to run Synduce over the internet without the need to download, build, and run Synduce in a command line interface. We provide you a much cleaner and intuitive interface through our web application, where you can write any scirpts you would like with the built-in code editor and then to run Synduce at the click of a button. You can then view log activity once the job has complete and see what Synduce was up to behind the scenes. 

 We also added some other features that would be quite useful to a research team. A user has the ability to create an account, which would allow them to view previous job history if they wish. You can also update your accounts password if you wish. **add some more stuff here**

 --- What is yet to be done (underlined) ---

 That is what we have done so far, however there are some features that are not entirely complete. For one, the log output is not displayed in a simple and fancy manner. We simply show the raw text output from Synduce. We would have liked to have had organised and catergorised log output to make it even easier to parse. Unfortunately, this required a deeper understanding as to what Synduce was telling us and we could not reliabley get the better log output set up. **add more here**

 --- Handoff instructions ---

 All the information that you will need to deploy the application including where to add credential information, how to edit and run the GitHub Actions scripts, and instructions on what you need from the project repository and how instructions to handoff the code base, are available in a README.md in the project repository under the "deliverable-4" directory. A link to that directory is here: **link to d4 folder in repo**

 You will also find extensive documentation and progress reports in the project repository that you can have a look at for additional information under the "deliverable-*" directory in the project repository. Most of these reports are not required to running and deploying the application but are available for your convenience. 

 If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns do not hesitate to email any of the team members, or of course, send us a message through discord. We would be happy to answer any question and even have a video chat with you to clarify anything relating to running the application, deployement, or the application itself if you wish. 

 On behalf of the entire team, we thank you again for the oppurunity and we hope you will enjoy using our application

 Sincerely,
 6 Devs 1 App
