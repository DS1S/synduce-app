# The Synduce Project

Over the past 4 months (Fall 2021) 5 friends and I have had the pleasure of architecting a solution for our partners at 
Uoft Software Engineering Labs as apart of their research project. Main contributions for this project go to:

Vedang Naik
Makan Dehizadeh
Daniel Saunders
Steven Ung
Aarya Patel
Asadullah Ahmed
